# Design of my website created while taking the Google UX Design course
This is the design of a website I created while taking the Google UX Design course. The purpose of this project was to put into practice the principles and techniques I learned during the course, such as user research, wireframing, prototyping, and testing. The website was designed with a mobile-first approach, and features a simple and clean layout with intuitive navigation. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes. Feel free to take a look at the design and let me know your thoughts!
